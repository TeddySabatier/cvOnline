        "description": "In this project, we developed a Java back-end using the Spring Boot framework to efficiently manage projects and users. Although it was a basic endeavor, it provided me with valuable insights into various principles related to Spring Boot back-ends. One of the notable accomplishments was learning how to conduct unit tests with Spring Boot. This experience significantly contributed to enhancing my proficiency in developing Spring Boot applications."

        "description": "The primary objective of this project was to introduce students to various complexities associated with hosting an infrastructure on the cloud. The infrastructure comprised a back-end, a webpage, and an AI program. The purpose was to create an oral quiz platform where users could answer questions verbally. My role focused on the machine learning aspect, involving the analysis and classification of audio answers (yes/no). This exposure to the field of machine learning sparked my interest and curiosity. The entire process, starting from data quality assessment and cleaning, to experimenting with different parameters/models, proved to be captivating and challenging. Thanks to the successful training of a specific model, our team achieved the best results in our class. Overall, this project served as an excellent introduction to the world of machine learning, and the skills acquired can now be applied to future projects."

        "description": "I am delighted to present my current project, Cubabois - an innovative order management software for logging activities. My name is Teddy Sabatier, a software and network engineering student, and I am passionate about creating digital solutions to meet the needs of businesses. During my final internship for my DUT GEII (University Technology Diploma in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing), I had the opportunity to develop an order management software for logging activities. Building on this successful experience, I decided to take it a step further and create a web and mobile version of this software, allowing companies to manage their orders remotely and in the field, even without an internet connection. This is how Cubabois was born. With this solution, you can take your smartphone or tablet to the field and enter your orders, even if you don't have an internet connection. Once you are back online, you can easily synchronize your data to ensure that everything is up to date and ready to be processed. I am confident that Cubabois will meet the needs of many logging companies by providing them with a simple and effective solution to manage their orders and activities."
